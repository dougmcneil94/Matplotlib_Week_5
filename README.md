Three observable trends based on the data:

1.	From the Pyber dataset we can see that urban ride shares tend to receive the lionâ€™s share of customers, having both a higher count of total number of rides per city, at around 68.4 percent of the total rides in the dataset, as well as a lower average fair. I suspect that ride shares are more popular in larger cities owing to population density as a factor of distance to destination per ride. In other words, riders travel shorter distance through greater traffic to get to their destination, usually with limited parking, making ridesharing an economic option. 

2.	Conversely, in rural settings with low population density, people drive greater distances to reach the resources they need and have plentiful parking options, making owning a car a necessity and affordable compared to taking an Uber or other ridesharing option over the same distance. The change in fare price compared to level of development is a direct linear relationship, as seen in the Pyber Ride Sharing Data Scatterplot. 


3.	The pricing of ride fares seems to be directly related to the supply and demand of drivers versus riders, respectively. There are less drivers available in suburban and rural areas, only around 19 percent of total drivers, but a high relative demand for rides at around 32 percent of requested rides, while the percentage of revenue for suburban and rural areas is high, around 37 percent compared to demand for rides, as opposed to urban environments, which tend to have a high demand at 68.4 percent, but only make up around 62.7 percent of the total revenue. All of this makes suburban areas are a great location for potential business development and growth. The greater availabilty of drivers in urban areas could be related to job specialization which is more possible in urban areas with higher population.
